My discord bot, GENSHI

-------------------------
 
A publication bot for my e-book of short stories. It implements node.js to call a random message function on a variable interval. Each short story is 
posted to a discord channel of the user's choice at the chosen interval. If you get a timeout, try lengthening the interval's millisecond variable so you 
send less requests per hour.
